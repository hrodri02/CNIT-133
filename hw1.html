                <img src="Heriberto_Rodriguez.jpeg" alt="Profile Picture of Heriberto Rodriguez.">
                <p>My name is Heriberto and it is my first semester taking classes at CCSF.
                    I am taking CNIT 132, 133 and CS 150, 160. I want to learn enough to create
                    a portfolio to make me more employable. I enjoy programming because to me
                    working on a project is like doing a challenging puzzle. I want to become a
                    full-stack web developer because there are a lot of jobs avaible for those
                    that know Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and backend technologies. It is my
                    third week taking classes and so far I am having a blast. I am glad that
                    CCSF is free because I would not be able to afford college otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In my free time, when I am not coding or tutoring I like to take long walks.
                   I live by the second largest park in San Francisco and there are a lot of nice
                   trails to walk through. I also like reading because it helps me reflect on
                   my own experiences and about the society I live in. Currently, I am reading The Hate U Give by
                   Angie Thomas.
                </p>
                <p>These are my favorite things to do in no particular order.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch soccer</li>
                    <li>Read</li>
                    <li>Take long walks</li>
                    <li>Code</li>
